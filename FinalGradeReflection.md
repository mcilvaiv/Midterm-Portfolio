I think that based on this porfolio submission I deserve a B. I have demonstarted sufficent leanring in all course objectives, but don't yet feel that I
have mastered evey objective. I have attended class, worked on activies and done outside research and worked on topics that intersted me. I belive that I have
mastered importing data,managing data, vizulizing data, and code documentation. I think I ca work on producing a more complicated simulation, displaying my ouput 
on a website or shiny app for my final project and more data cleaning.
