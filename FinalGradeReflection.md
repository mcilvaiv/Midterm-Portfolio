# Final Grade Reflection

I think that based on my porfolio submission I deserve a B+. I feel that I have satisifed the Import, manage, and clean data objective as shown through my project and my covid data study that I am working on. I feel that I haven proven my ability to isolate key information, restructure data, and modify data to be in a more workable format. 

I also feel that I have satisfied the create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentations course objective. This course objective has been my favovirte to work towards and where I feel I have made the most progress. I think I have shown through my project, code, and outputs that I am able to create many different types of visulizations for exploratory analysis and numerical summaries. 


Additionally, I think that I have demonstrated that I can write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs. For the most part, I have been remembering to use good, desprective comments, name code chuncks with fitting names, and wrtie code that could be interpreted by someone else. 


I think I have shown that I can Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs. I used packages like highcharter, plottly, and distill and looked to online resources to help learn how to effectively use these packages. I feel that I have become a lot better at identifying errors in my own programs. I remember in the first few weeks of class just starring at my screen having no idea what "object not found" meant. Today, I feel that I can easily identify simple mistakes from the notes in the console. 


I feel that I have shown good progress in wirting R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments, but I think that this is the area that I struggled most in. I have struggled with simulations in every programming language. However, I do feel proud of the progress that I have in this course objective. 


For these reasons and the work that I have shown, I feel that a B+ is fitting for all progress that I have made this semester. 

Hope you have a nice 2 week break between semesters!
I will be stopping by sometime in the fall to get my sticker!
