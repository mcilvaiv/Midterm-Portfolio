# Growth as a Data Person

Going into this class, most of the programming experinces I had was in SAS. I took Java years ago and did not retain much value from the class. At the end the end of this course, I hope to feel accomplished and satisfied with what I have learned and how I have been able to show what I have learned. I already feel much more comfortable in R and GitHub and hope to be able to demonstrate my most significant areas of growth by the end of this course.

Thoughout the course, I have become much more confident with the idea of "open source" programming. While, I have loved the freedom that this brings to my coding, the limitlessness of it is sometimes difficult for me.
