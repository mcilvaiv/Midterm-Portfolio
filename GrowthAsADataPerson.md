# Growth as a Data Person

Going into this class, most of the programming experince I had was in SAS. I took Java years ago and did not retain much value from the class. At the end the end of this course, I feel much more satisfied with all the progress that I have made. 

Thoughout the course, I have become much more confident with the idea of "open source" programming. While, I have loved the freedom that this brings to my coding, but the limitlessness of it is still sometimes difficult for me. I have become very familiar with what packages do what. I have a good understanding of the tidyverse and the packages that are installed with that library and when I need to look to further packages to do different things. 



I have become better at knowing how to phrase my questions and how to effectively learn from online resources. Throughout the course, R has become more exciting and less dautning to me. Since I have more a stats background and less of a programming background, I have been able to use my statistical knowledge in a way that fosters creativity and pushes me to explore new ways to vizualize and simualte data. Throughout the past few months, I have learned how to import various forms or raw data, create my own data, and vizulize it an effective way. At the end of the day, I strive to be a data person that can transform data into more meaningful messages for the everyday person. I believe that I am getting closer and closer to that goal as my skills in R expand and as I continue to learn throughout the classes in my program.

I think this class has helped become a more knowledgeable data person. Having experience in R will help me become a more well-rounded data person. Knowing multiple languages seems essential in today's world. GitHub has been eally cool for me in this class. I would like to explore more in github and see how I can learn through others projects and programs.
