# Growth as a Data Person

Going into this class, most of the programming experinces I had was in SAS. I took Java years ago and did not retain much value from the class. At the end the end of this course, I hope to feel accomplished and satisfied with what I have learned and how I have been able to show what I have learned. I alrady feel much more comfortable in R and GitHub and hope to be able to demonstrat my most significant areas of growth by the end of this course.
