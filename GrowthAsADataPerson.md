# Growth as a Data Person

Going into this class, most of the programming experince I had was in SAS. I took Java years ago and did not retain much value from the class. At the end the end of this course, I hope to feel accomplished and satisfied with what I have learned and how I have been able to show what I have learned. I already feel much more comfortable in R and GitHub and hope to be able to demonstrate my most significant areas of growth by the end of this course.

Thoughout the course, I have become much more confident with the idea of "open source" programming. While, I have loved the freedom that this brings to my coding, the limitlessness of it is sometimes difficult for me. I have become better at knowing how to phrase my questions and how to effectively learn from online resources. Throughout the course, R has become more exciting and less dautning to me. Since I have more a stats background and less of a programming background, I have been able to use my statistical knowledge in a way that fosters creativity and pushes me to explore new ways to vizualize and simualte data. Throughout the past few months, I have learned how to import various forms or raw data, create my own data, and vizulize it an effective way. At the end of the day, I strive to be a data person that can transform data into more meaningful messages for the everyday person. I believe that I am getting closer and closer to that goal as my skills in R expand and as I comtinue to learn throughout the program.

GitHub has been a really cool, new thing for me in this class. I would like to explore more in github and see how I can learn through others projects and programs.
