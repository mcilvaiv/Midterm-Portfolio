# Growth as a Data Person

Going into this class, most of the programming experince I had was in SAS. I took Java years ago and did not retain much value from the class. At the end the end of this course, I feel much more satisfied with all the progress that I have made. 

Thoughout the course, I have become much more confident with the idea of "open source" programming. While, I have loved the freedom that this brings to my coding, the limitlessness of it is still sometimes difficult for me. I have become very familiar with what packages do what. I have a good understanding of the tidyverse and its packages and when I need to look into uses packages outside of the tidyverse. I have learned how to import data from different sources in R (csvs, xlxs, and using data that exists in R). I have learned how to manipulate data in R in both similar and different ways from SAS. My knowledge from this course had helped me become a more versatile data person. Leanring what kinds of things I prefer to do in R and things I prefer to do in SAS hasbeen very helpful in my growth as a data person. I have loved exploring the vizulization aspect of R. GGplot2, Highcharter, ploty, and ggcorrplot  profuce way cooler vizulizations than anything I've ever done in SAS. Going into my future career, I feel that I have a new bag of skills that I did not have before taking this course. 


I have become better at knowing how to phrase my questions and how to effectively learn from online resources. Throughout the course, R has become more exciting for me. Since I have more a stats background and less of a programming background, I have been able to use my statistical knowledge in a way that fosters creativity and pushes me to explore new ways to vizualize and simualte data. Throughout the past few months, I have learned how to import various forms or raw data, clean it, create my own data, and vizulize it an effective way. This class has helped me become a more knowledgable data person that can transform data into more meaningful messages for the everyday person.

Having experience in R has made me a more well-rounded data person. Knowing multiple languages seems essential in today's world. GitHub has been a really cool for me in this class.
