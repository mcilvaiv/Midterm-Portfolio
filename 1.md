# Import, manage, and clean data
For my project, I will import this [Superbowl data set](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/superbowl-ads/blob/main/superbowl-ads.csv)
along with one or two more datasets to be determined. I will merge the data sets by year, clean the datasets to make sure the columns and rows that I want to keep are retianed. I will also add columns to dataframes using tibble and dplyr. 
> Ex) Merge the Superbowl dataset with another dataset containng year and price of ad per second, create a column called Price by multiplying the price per second by the number of seconds the ad is




# Importing csv files from project folder into .rmd

```{r upload files}
data_ad <- read_csv("~/STA 518/Final Project/project_proposal/Superbowl ad csv - Sheet1 (2).csv")
data_ad_time <- read_csv("~/STA 518/Final Project/project_proposal/Ad  Time _ Category - Sheet1 (1).csv")
data_ad_cost <- read_csv("~/STA 518/Final Project/project_proposal/Cost per Super bowl ad 2000-2020 - Sheet1.csv")
data <-read_csv("~/STA 518/Final Project/project_proposal/combined  - Sheet1 (2).csv")
```

# Cleaning and Merging Superbowl Data
> In the code below I am joing two datasets by year in order to make a full data set that contains ad cost and the rest of descriptive columns of the ads.  I used a dim() statement to check that the inner_join resulted in what I wanted it to do. Since the ad_cost variable was a chr and not numeric, I need to find a way to it numeric. First, I needed to remove the "$" and "," from the values. 
```{r joining two data sets }

# merge data and data_ad_cost together 
total <- inner_join(data, data_ad_cost, by="year")
total
# check to conform numbe of rows and columns is accurate
dim(total)


#chr to Numeric cost_per_minute and cost_per_thirty_seconds
total11<-
total%>% as.data.frame %>%
  mutate(cost_per_minute=str_remove_all(cost_per_minute,"[$,]"),
         cost_per_minute=as.numeric(cost_per_minute)) %>%

  mutate(cost_per_thirty_seconds=str_remove_all(cost_per_thirty_seconds,"[$,]"),
        cost_per_thirty_seconds=as.numeric(cost_per_thirty_seconds))%>%
  
  mutate(cost_per_second = cost_per_minute/60 )%>%
  
  mutate(cost_of_ad= cost_per_second*ad_time) %>%
  mutate(cost_of_ad_in_millions =cost_of_ad/1000000 )%>%
  mutate(cost_per_second_in_thousands =cost_per_second/100000)

# Cleaning Covid Data
> In the code chuck below, I am selecting the dates that I am intersted for this covid study. My goal was to create a dates file that has a singular column called "Days" that represents the number of days between a speific date and the date that covid symptoms began. To do this, I first checked for missing dates using aan anti-join and found that there are 6 individuals that don't have a date_covid value. In order to get the data in a longer format, I used a pivot_longer to change the dates into one column. "date-event" and send the date values to a new column called "date". After the pivoting, I made the "days" column using mutate and dropped the "date_covid". This dates file is now in proper form to make spagetti plots with days on the x axis. Now I have a better layout of my data, I can am ready to add the coresponding scores and will be able to create spaghetti plots.

```{r Creating Dates File}

data1 <- data %>% 
  select( record_id, redcap_event_name,
