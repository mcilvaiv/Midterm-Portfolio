# Import, manage, and clean data
For my project, I will import this [Superbowl data set](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/superbowl-ads/blob/main/superbowl-ads.csv)
along with one or two more datasets to be determined. I will merge the data sets by year, clean the datasets to make sure the columns and rows that I want to keep are retianed. I will also add columns to dataframes using tibble and dplyr. 
> Ex) Merge the Superbowl dataset with another dataset containng year and price of ad per second, create a column called Price by multiplying the price per second by the number of seconds the ad is


```{r joining two data sets }
# merge data and data_ad_cost together 
total <- inner_join(data, data_ad_cost, by="year")
total
dim(total)


#chr to Numeric cost_per_minute and cost_per_thirty_seconds
total%>%
  mutate(cost_per_minute=str_remove_all(cost_per_minute,"[$,]"),
         cost_per_minute=as.numeric(cost_per_minute)) %>%

  mutate(cost_per_thirty_seconds=str_remove_all(cost_per_thirty_seconds,"[$,]"),
        cost_per_thirty_seconds=as.numeric(cost_per_thirty_seconds))%>%
  
  mutate(cost_per_second = cost_per_minute/60 )%>%
  
  mutate(cost_of_ad= cost_per_second*ad_time)
```
