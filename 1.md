# Import, manage, and clean data
For my project, I will import this [Superbowl data set](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/superbowl-ads/blob/main/superbowl-ads.csv)
along with one or two more datasets to be determined. I will merge the data sets by year, clean the datasets to make sure the columns and rows that I want to keep are retianed. I will also add columns to dataframes using tibble and dplyr. 
> Ex) Merge the Superbowl dataset with another dataset containng year and price of ad per second, create a column called Price by multiplying the price per second by the number of seconds the ad is
