# Bootstrapping
> In the code below I am using the bootstrapping method as a way to resample from a small data sample. I created data with 25 participatns. I wanted to find out if there is a differnce in weight loss for people on a carnivore diet vs. a vegan diet. First I created my data. Next, I arranged the data by diet so that my data will be in proper order for a for loop. I graphed a simple boxplot to see if there apperaed to be a differnce then calcualted the mean weightloss for both carnivore and vegan diets. Next, I calcualted the observed test statistics using mean and median differnce between the two diets. After this, I was ready to begin bootstrapping. I first set a seed just so that my results could be reproduceable. I created a variable n to represent that number of obsevations and b to represent that I am going to take 15000 samples and then I created a variable "weight" for the sampling. Then I got my samples using matrix() and the variables that I previously made and checked that the dimensions aligned with what I wanted. Next, I created 15000 empty vectors. Then I used two for loops to calc test stat for the mean and median. I lookeda at the first 10 test stats for both and then saw which ones had a higher test stat than the observed one. Then I calculated the p-values for comparing mean and median weight loss. 
```{r boot Strapping}
record_id= c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25)
weight_loss= c(9,10,5,11,10,7,8,9,5,4,6,7,2,8,7,9,2,9,8,8,4,15,6,8,12)
diet=c("vegan", "vegan", "carnivore", "vegan","vegan", "carnivore","carnivore","carnivore","carnivore", "vegan","carnivore", "vegan", "carnivore", "carnivore", "vegan","carnivore", "carnivore", "vegan", "vegan", "carnivore", "vegan", "vegan", "carnivore", "carnivore","vegan")

#making data frame
diets<- data.frame(record_id, 
                    weight_loss, diet,
                    stringsAsFactors = F)
diets

diets2<- diets%>%
  arrange(diet)

#check to see if there appears to be a difference
bp <- ggplot(diets2, aes(x=diet, y=weight_loss)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

mean(diets2$weight_loss[diets2$diet=="vegan"])

mean(diets2$weight_loss[diets2$diet=="carnivore"])

#calc observed test stat

observed_test_stat1 <-abs(mean(diets2$weight_loss[diets2$diet=="carnivore"])-
                            mean(diets2$weight_loss[diets2$diet=="vegan"]))
observed_test_stat1

#median
observed_test_stat2 <-abs(median(diets2$weight_loss[diets2$diet=="carnivore"])-
                            median(diets2$weight_loss[diets2$diet=="vegan"]))

                         mean(bootstrap_samples[14:25,i]))
  
}


#median
for(i in 1:b){
  test_stat2[i] <- abs(median(bootstrap_samples[1:13,i])-
                         median(bootstrap_samples[14:25,i]))
  
}

#glance at first 10
round(test_stat1[1:10],1)
round(test_stat2[1:10],1)

#p-value, looking for # bootstrap test stats that are greater then the observed/ n. 2/10 returned True
(test_stat1 >=observed_test_stat1)[1:10]

#for mean
mean(test_stat1>= observed_test_stat1)
#for median
mean(test_stat2>= observed_test_stat2)

# Beginning with Simple Probability Simulations
> I wanted to replicate a coin toss simualtion that I had done is SAS. To do this, I used Base R to create a sample of 10 coin tosses. Then I used teh Replicate function to simulate replicating those 10 coin tosses 50 times.
```{r Begin simulation coin toss, binomial}
#tossing a coin

coin_toss= c("Heads", "Tails")
set.seed(1)
y=sample(coin_toss, 10, replace = TRUE ) #take sample of 10
length(y[y=="Heads"])
y

#replicate tosses 50 times 
replicate(50, sample( coin_toss, 10, replace= TRUE))
first=replicate(50, length(sample(coin_toss, 10, replace= TRUE)[y=="Heads"])) #assign vector first
mean(first)

#bimonial

rbinom(20, 4, .2)
table(rbinom(20, 4, .2))
```

```{r simulating from  binomial dist of 10 with p=.42}
x <- 0:10
x

#vector of probabilities from binomial dist of 10
sim <-dbinom(x, 10, .42)
sim
#check to make sure sum=1
sum(sim)

weighted.mean(x,sim)
#varaince
weighted.mean((x-4.2)^2, sim)
#sd
weighted.mean((x-4.2)^2, sim)^.5

#prob histogram
qplot(x,weight=sim, geom="histogram", bins=10)+
ggtitle("Probability Histogram")

```
