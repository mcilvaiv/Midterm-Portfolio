## 1.
> For my project, I will import this super bowl data set https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/superbowl-ads/blob/main/superbowl-ads.csv 
along with one or two more datasets to be determined. I will merge the data sets by year, clean the datasets to make sure the columns and rows that I want to keep are retianed. 
## 2.
> I will create graphical displays such as box plots, bar charts, and predictive models.
> Some tenative ideas are:
-  box plots showing the distribution of length of super bowl adds by year, industry, and brand
-  bar chart of counts by brand and indistry of # of ads that contain sex appeal
-  determine if there is any correaltion between industrys and thier use of comedy, sex appeal, and animals in super bowls ads
-  look at how the cost of super bowl adds have changed over time
-  use predictive modeling to determine what future ads could look like
