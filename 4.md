# Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs.

 So far, I have been referring back to the online book along with the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) website when I get stuck or need to look up documentation. Additionally, I have been communicating with my team memebers on the in class assignemnts when I get lost and need some direction. I have also enjoyted watching youtube videos of special topics and will continue to use this as a source to learn new information. 


# Using Forcats 
```{r boxplot, reorder }
ggplot(data=total11, aes(x= fct_reorder(category, cost_of_ad_in_millions), y=cost_of_ad_in_millions))+
geom_boxplot(fill="lightblue")+
ggtitle("Boxplots of Cost Per Ad by Category")+
xlab("Ad Category")+
ylab("Ad Cost in Millions")
```
