# Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs.

 So far, I have been referring back to the online book along with the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) website when I get stuck or need to look up documentation. Additionally, I have been communicating with my team memebers on the in class assignemnts when I get lost and need some direction. I have also enjoyted watching youtube videos of special topics and will continue to use this as a source to learn new information.
