# Lightning Round
1. What was the most difficult part of the class for you? List a general topic, a specific problem, a kind of work we did, etc. and explain why.
> The most difficult part of the class for me has been functions and simulations. I have always struggled with simualtions and the idea of creating my own function is very new to me. The aspects of R that are most difficult for me are the parts that are the most different from SAS.
2. What was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why
> So far, the easiest part of this class has been finding source documentation when I feel lost. I think I have mastered how to efficiently search for documentation using keywords.
3. What part of the class surprised or interested you the most? Explain why.
> It has surpised me how much you can really do in R and how different it is from SAS. I guess I thought R would be more simialr than SAS. I am also suprised that I like the online format of the class. Coding alone on my couch is a lot less stresful than doing it in a classroom!
4. Give one piece of advice to a student just beginning a semester of STA 418/518 that will help them be successful in learning.
> I would advise incoming students to do the primers and pre class work well-before class. Unfortauntely with my work schedule, I find muself doing the pre class activities a few hours beffore class and this doesn't allow me to have much time for the inforamtion to sink in before attending class. Additaionlly, I would suggest that students take time outside of class to research and learn about the specific things in R that interst them. I have found it especially fun to look into the vizulizations that are possible in R.
