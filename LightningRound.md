# Lightning Round
1. What was the most difficult part of the class for you? List a general topic, a specific problem, a kind of work we did, etc. and explain why.
> The most difficult part of the class for me has been functions and simulations. I have always struggled with conceptualizing simualtions. The aspects of R that are most difficult for me are the parts that are the most different from SAS. The programming window itslef took a while for me to get used to. It's a bit more "busier" looking than SAS and JAVA. I have also found it difficult to become familar with the package, function, and key word names.. there is so much to remember! 
2. What was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why
> So far, the easiest part of this class has been finding source documentation when I feel lost. I think I have mastered how to efficiently search for documentation using keywords.
3. What part of the class surprised or interested you the most? Explain why.
> It has surpised me how much you can really do in R and how different it is from SAS. I guess I thought R would be more simialr than SAS. I am also suprised that I like the online format of the class. Coding alone on my couch is a lot less stresful than doing it in a classroom! I have really enjoyed the team aspect in Gather, I defietely prefer it to Zoom. The thing that has intersted me the most is the graphics and all the custimizations you can make. SAS lacks a but in cool graphics and I have really enjoyed getting to be more creative in R. 
4. Give one piece of advice to a student just beginning a semester of STA 418/518 that will help them be successful in learning.
> I would advise incoming students to do the primers and pre class work well-before class. Unfortauntely with my work schedule, I find muself doing the pre class activities a few hours beffore class and this doesn't allow me to have much time for the inforamtion to sink in before attending class. Additaionlly, I would suggest that students take time outside of class to research and learn about the specific things in R that interst them. I have found it especially fun to look into the vizulizations that are possible in R.
